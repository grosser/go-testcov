## Notes

 - [coverage in go](https://blog.golang.org/cover)
 - Runtime overhead of is about 3%
 - Use `-covermode atomic` when testing parallel algorithms


## Development

Test files are named `.gotest`, so they do not install test dependencies (gomega / ginko) when doing `go get`.

```
make dev            # rename .gottest to _test.go
make undev          # rename _test.go to .gotest
make test           # run go-testcov on itself
make integration    # run everything travis runs locally
```
